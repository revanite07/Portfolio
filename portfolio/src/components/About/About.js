      <h1>Hey there! </h1>

      <h3 className=''>My name is Kelan Moffatt.</h3>

        <p> I am Full-Stack Web Developer that likes to be challenged. 
          When I was 7 years old I got my first experience with computers with a Windows '95 machine. 
          I was immediately enthralled. I started with flying sims with a handy joy stick to fly the skies..
           Ever since I've been passionate about all things related to technology. I am always learning new ways to interact with technology. 
           This passion for technology has propelled me into a life of coding. I've been loving every minute of it. 
           The constant learning and challenges have pushed me to better not only my code but myself as well. 
           I am excited for what the future of coding brings me next.'
